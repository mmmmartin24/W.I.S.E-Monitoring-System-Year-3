<h2> W.I.S.E (Wireless IoT Surgical Environment) Monitoring System </h2>

📡 Project Overview
W.I.S.E is an IoT-based real-time monitoring system designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of a surgical environment. By integrating wireless sensor networks and smart monitoring, this system helps track critical environmental conditions within an operating room.
This project was developed as the final project for my Internet of Things Architecture (IEE3031) course at Calvin Institute of Technology.

🎯 Objectives
- Monitor key parameters in a surgical room environment.
- Alert stakeholders to any deviations in real-time.
- Utilize affordable, reliable IoT components with wireless communication.

⚙️ Technologies Used
- Microcontroller: NodeMCU ESP8266
- Sensors: Environmental sensors (e.g., gas, temperature, humidity)
- Communication: Wi-Fi-based MQTT protocol
- Dashboard: Real-time data visualization on a web interface
- Cloud: MQTT broker for data distribution

🗂️ Project Structure
- Hardware: ESP8266 NodeMCU + connected sensors
- Software: Embedded firmware for data acquisition and MQTT publishing
- Dashboard: Accessible via any web browser for live monitoring

📈 Features
- Wireless monitoring of operating room conditions
- Real-time data updates via MQTT
- Portable and scalable architecture
- Potential for sensor upgrades to improve accuracy

🚀 Getting Started
- Hardware Setup: Connect sensors to the ESP8266 microcontroller.
- Firmware Deployment: Upload the firmware using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
- Connect to Wi-Fi: Configure the SSID and password in the code.
- MQTT Broker: Set up an MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) or use a public broker.
- Dashboard Access: Open the web dashboard to visualize the data.
